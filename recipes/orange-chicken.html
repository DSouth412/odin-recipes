    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you've enjoyed this classic Chinese take-out meal from Panda Express or <br>
        P.F. Chang's, you're gonna love this easy homemade recipe. This is an easy <br>
        and quick recipe that can be made on a weeknight.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is has become an absolute staple in my house. I love this recipe and <br>
        tell everyone I know how tasty it is. After hyper fixating on this meal when <br>
        I first discovered it, I'm still making it every week years later.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Chicken Tenders</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. corn starch</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. ginger powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>White vinegar for cleaning the chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white rice <em>(for the side dish)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Orange Chicken Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tbsp. corn starch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tbsp. rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. ginger powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>zest of 1 orange</li>
        <li>Chili flakes <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the chicken into 1 inch cubes and place in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Fill the bowl with white vinegar to a little above the chicken. Swirl the chicken around<br>
            and then let it soak in the vinegar for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the chicken soaks, mix the flour, corn starch, onion powder, paprika, ginger powder,<br>
            black pepper, and salt in a measuring cup. Next, bring the oil in your pan up to medium<br>
            heat. </li>
        <li>After that, start to wash your rice in a separate bowl at least 5 times and set aside drained.</li>
        <li>Drain your chicken in a colander and rinse the bowl out, then place the chicken back in<br>
            the bowl. Pour your flour mixture in and mix it all up, then add the coated pieces to your<br>
            frying pan. Fry the chicken until golden brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the clean rice to a pot. Fill with water about a cm over the rice. Add salt to<br>
            the water (not too much). Place on high heat until it starts boiling, then lower the heat<br>
            to low and cover for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk all the sauce ingredients together in the measuring cup or a bowl<br>
            (I add the chili flakes as the sauce is cooking to adjust the heat).<br>
            After removing the chicken from the frying pan, pour the sauce into the pan and cook on<br>
            low-medium heat and stir until it thickens up.</li>
        <li>Transfer the fried chicken to the sauce and mix to coat well. Transfer rice into bowls for<br>
            eating and cover with portion of sauced chicken.</li>
        <li>Garnish with (optional) sesame seeds and chopped green onions.</li>
    </ol>
