    <p>If you've enjoyed this classic Chinese take-out meal from Panda Express or <br>
        P.F. Chang's, you're gonna love this easy homemade recipe. This is an easy <br>
        and quick recipe that can be made on a weeknight.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is has become an absolute staple in my house. I love this recipe and <br>
        tell everyone I know how tasty it is. After hyper fixating on this meal when <br>
        I first discovered it, I'm still making it every week years later.
