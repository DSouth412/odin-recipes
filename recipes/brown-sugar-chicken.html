        <li>2 tbsps. olive oil</li>
        <li>White vinegar <em>for cleaning the chicken</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Brown Sugar Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp. dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp corn starch</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. <strong>EACH</strong> (dried) parsley, oregano, thyme.</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the chicken tenders in half and place in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Fill the bowl with white vinegar to a little above the chicken. Swirl the chicken around<br>
            and then let it soak in the vinegar for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the chicken soaks, mix the flour and all the chicken seasoning in a small bowl. <br>
            Reserve 1 tbsp. of the mixture and put aside for the sauce.</li>
        <li>Melt the 2 tbsps. of butter and the 2 tbsps. of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Drain your chicken in a colander and rinse the bowl out, then place the chicken back in<br>
            the bowl. Pour your flour mixture in and mix it all up, then add the coated pieces to your<br>
            frying pan. Fry the chicken until golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the <br>
            chicken to a plate and don't wipe out the skillet.</li>
        <li>Mix the chicken broth with the cornstarch in a small bowl and add to the skillet, followed by <br>
            all the sauce ingredients, including the reserved tbsp. of the flour mixture. Bring the sauce <br>
            to a simmer until it thickens to the desired consistency. Add more lemon juice for tangier/less <br>
            sweet taste if desired. Add the red chili flakes and adjust to your desired spice heat level.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to skillet and and spoon some sauce over top. Garnish with fresh or dried parsley <br>
            and serve with mashed potatoes or rice. If the chicken is too sweet, garnish with lemon juice.</li>
    </ol>
